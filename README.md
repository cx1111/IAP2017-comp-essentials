# Computing Essentials for Scientists and Engineers

These classes aim to teach concepts and habits that make programming a more simplified and comfortable process for those who did not study
computer science. 

The presenter will use slideshows and read/write/manipulate files and programs during the sessions. Class participation is encouraged. 


No prerequisites. Advanced signup required. 3 Sessions (first session is helpful for subsequent ones):

- Tue 24 Jan, 1800-1900
- Wed 25 Jan, 1800-1900
- Thu 26 Jan, 1800-1900

## Session 1 - Storage and Interpretation of Files 

Content: 

- Information storage. ASCII, UTF, binary dat files, etc. 
- Source code, machine code, and in between. 
- File types. Everything is binary, it just depends how programs use/interpret it. 
- The PATH environment variable and calling executables from the terminal/command line.
- Virtual environments in Python. 

Learning Outcomes:

- Understand the common basis of all files and that interpretation is contextual. 
- Know the directory structure of your OS
- Know where your programs are or should be.  
- Feel comfortable dealing with all file types and place less importance on file extensions.
- Understand why program installers exist and why you usually don't just download the final program.
- Know what is happening when you are looking at a 'corrupt' (not actually corrupt) file.

## Session 2 - Programming Languages and Important Selections

Content: 

- What is/isn't a programming language? 
- Compiled vs Interpreted. Common misconceptions.  
- Programming with and without integrated development environments (IDEs)
- Low level - C
- High level - Python/Matlab
- Multiplatform development - Java
- Relational Databases - SQL

Learning Outcomes:

- Know what actually happens when a programming language is said to be compiled or interpreted.
- Understand the context of low and high level languages. 
- Understand the importance of relational databases.

## Session 3 - Version Control and Collaboration

Content:

- Importance of version control and collaborative software development
- Tracking changes using Git
	- The git workflow
	- Initializing git repository
	- Staging 
	- Branches
	- Merges and conflicts
- Collaborative development using GitHub
	- Remotes
	- Cloning
	- Pulling - Fetch + Merge
	- Pushing
	- Remote Branches

Learning Outcomes:

- Understand that modern software development is collaborative and built upon the work of others. 
- Understand the importance of version control and feel comfortable with basic git commands. 
- Want to use git and Github for your future projects.

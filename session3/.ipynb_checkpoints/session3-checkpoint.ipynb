    "Git is a widely used version control software that lets us keep track of changes in our files. \n",

    "## Why Version Control with Git? ##\n",
    "\n",
    "- Able to retrieve past versions of a file.\n",
    "  - Avoid having to save multiple copies of the same file under different names at different points of its history.\n",
    "  - If you keep one copy without version control, you will (essentially) never be able to retrieve past versions of files.\n",
    "- Able to view changes and developments in your work. \n",
    "- Backs up your files in case you accidentally delete them. \n",
    "- You can host git repositories on remote servers such as Github and Bitbucket in order to work collaboratively. This simultaneously serves as a cloud backup for your files. \n",
    "\n",

    "## How do you track files in Git? ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Git stores data as a series of snapshots. Work on the files in your project like normal. When you decide that you want to take a snapshot of the state of your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose the changed content you want to keep track of and add them to the staging area. \n",
    "2. Commit all the content in the staging area. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogy: You are an artist who works with paintings (files). You can start new paintings, (create new files), work on paintings (edit files), and throw away paintings (delete files). You have a cameraman who takes pictures (commits) when you decide. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You make a few new paintings and work on another painting. You choose to put them on a stage where the cameraman is ready to take a picture of them.\n",
    "2. You tell the cameraman to take a picture of all the paintings you put on the stage. Remember, if you work on some paintings or make some new paintings but you didn't put any of them onto the stage, the cameraman doesn't take a picture of anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How are things tracked in Git? ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Git stores data as a series of snapshots. When you make a commit, Git stores a **commit object** with a unique identifier that contains:\n",
    "    - A snapshot of the content you staged. \n",
    "    - A pointer to the commit object that was the direct parent of the commit*.\n",
    "    - Metadata: author and commit message.\n",
    "\n",
    "*or one pointer to each parent if the commit came from a merge\n",
